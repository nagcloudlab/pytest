# Considerations
# Test Environment: Ensure Kafka is accessible from your test environment with the correct topics created.
# Asynchronous Processing: Kafka streaming applications are inherently asynchronous. You might need to add delays or retries in your test to wait for the processed data.
# Idempotency and Cleanup: Each test run should be idempotent, meaning it should not be affected by previous runs. Ensure that your setup and teardown steps adequately prepare and clean up the test environment.
# Scalability of Tests: Consider how your tests might scale with larger volumes of data or more complex processing logic. You may need to adjust timeouts, partitioning, or parallelism settings.
